## Workflow
### Making
Basic description of how and what order I made the methods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started with *printActivities* as my first method. To test it out, I added the *if statement to call it on script start*. I then branched out to call *printActivitiesFromList* to print the different activities, instead of doing it from printActivities itself.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then made the *main* method, the *makeChoice* and *choice* method and connected printActivities to it. I introduced try catch statements to catch the errors from input. I added the concept of reverting to main menu using 0.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I added the *add* and *add_choice* method and then *addParent*, *addTo_Parent*, *addActivities* and *addTo_Activities* methods. Next I added the *addMore_Parent* and *addMore_Activities* methods.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly I proof tested all the methods and ran every possible combination to test it out. I then commented the code and added the ReadMe


### Git
Git Workflow

* Created a git repository initialized with a ReadMe
* Cloned it locally
* Branched it to challenge-file
* Added the downloaded challenge file to it, added a gitignore, incase required, and made my first commit to the branch
* Pulled changes from the branch to master
* Deleted the branch, as it was no longer required.
* Wrote the code to the answer to the challenge and the ReadMe to a branch called answer.
* Followed the same process as above.
